    <p>In the United States, local public goods are primarily financed through property taxes. Despite their ubiquity, property taxes are distortionary relative to head taxes. This paper develops a spatial equilibrium model to quantify the welfare effects of local property taxation. I estimate an elasticity of substitution for housing of 0.27, rejecting a common assumption that households have unit elastic demand for housing. Counterfactual simulations show that switching to head taxes increases housing supply by 2%, but decreases equity and increases income segregation. Under a property tax system, low-income households receive implicit transfers of approximately $1,900, whereas high-income households pay $5,100. Redistribution through a progressive tax system is significantly constrained by high-income household mobility.</p>
