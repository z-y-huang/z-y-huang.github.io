I am a Ph.D student in Economics at Stanford University. I am a [Health Policy Research Scholar](https://healthpolicyresearch-scholars.org) at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a [Predoctoral Scholar](https://med.stanford.edu/phs/about/people/postdocs.html) at the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences.

My research interests include public, urban, and health economics.
